Debian DEB, APT, Aptitude, DPKG

- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 
    - The Source!
    - Oldest Linux Distro #2 after Slackware
    - First Linux Distro that was open for every developer to contribute, and is still the most significant non-commercial distributor of Linux
    - Has the largest team of volunteer contributors. 
    - There is corporate support for Debian, but no corporate ownership.
    - High quality documentation is readily available online.
    - All of the embedded Linux processors and boards that I support and use have Linux BSP’s that are ultimately derived from Debian, such as Rasberry Pi OS and NXP embedded linux.
    - The highly improved debian-installer is mediocre compared to Calamares, but at least it works. 
        - In the mid-2000's I tried to install debian a few times and was never successful.
    - Insists on installer images being free software only, so important drivers are missing. This is extremely annoying and limits the ability of novices to successfully install this distro.  Unofficial installers are available with drivers though, but its not easy to identify them.
- Debian branches:
    - [Debian “Sid” Unstable](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable)
        - Rolling release
        - Bleeding-edge like Arch (but slightly more stable)
        - Ideal for developers and desktops
    - [Debian Testing](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianTesting)
        - Rolling release
        - Downstream of Debian Sid
        - Fairly Modern
        - Ideal for desktops
        - I prefer this Testing rolling release to the ultra-stable point releases of Debian. This is what I install when I want Debian on a laptop or desktop.
    - [Debian Stable](https://www.debian.org/)
        - THE MOST STABLE!
        - Point release
        - Downstream of Debian Testing
        - This is what most people use, and should be the only version used on servers
        - [Debian Backports](https://backports.debian.org/) can keep Debian Stable feeling fresh for workstations
- [Siduction](https://siduction.org/)
    - Based on Debian "Sid" Unstable
    - Rolling release, Germany
    - KDE Plasma, Xfce, Lxqt
    - They write their own user [manual](https://manual.siduction.org/siduction-manual_en.pdf).  Their [github](https://github.com/siduction) stores the configuration and mods to offer to build their distro.
    - The installer is configured for Btrfs + rollback.
    - This distro is nicely polished and I like it a lot.  I am running it on three of my computers.  
- [Spiral](https://spirallinux.github.io/)  Linux - ***NEW AND PROMISING***
    - This is more of a Debian installer than an actual distro
    - Based on Debian stable but easily upgraded to Testing or Sid
    - KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, Gnome, etc….
    - BtrFS + LUKS, Flatpack management through GUI, zRAM,
    - Single developer previously maintained Gecko Linux and has switched to Debian from OpenSUSE
    - I tested this in early 2023 and it is almost excellent, it just needs some more polishing, but not bad for a first release!
- [DebianEasy�](https://debianeasy.github.io/)�
    - Forked from Spiral, removed some default install apps
    - Can download the [ISO](https://sourceforge.net/projects/debianeasy-bookworm/files/2023_6_11/) or the [build system](https://github.com/DebianEasy/DebianEasy-iso)
- [Neptune](https://neptuneos.com/en/start-page.html)
    - Based on Debian stable, newer kernel, newer drivers, newer utilities, newer DE, persistent USB installer
    - KDE Plasma
    - Germany
    - I tested this in early 2023 and it is decent.  There are some nice KDE Plasma themes.  install is okay.  
- [Sparky](https://sparkylinux.org/)
    - Poland
    - Stable and Testing
- [SolydXK](https://solydxk.com/)
    - Based on Debian Stable.  Netherlands.
    - Originally started as Linux Mint Debian Edition with KDE Plasma DE
    - There are two flavors, KDE and Xfce
    - SolydK: KDE Plasma DE
        - I tried SolydK in 2023.  It had not been updated since 2021 and was based on the previously released debian distro, so it felt old.  default partitioning was strange, seperating home from root but using ext4 is not ideal.  at least it allowed me to use xfs filesystem or btrfs on the install, so that has some promise.   it ships with some interesting kde plasma themes which may be worth looking at.   I will not use this.
    - SolydX: Xfce nDE
- [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/) - ***POPULAR***

- [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) - ***POPULAR***
    - Ubuntu non-LTS is downstream of Debian Sid (Unstable)
    - Ubuntu LTS is downstream of Debian Testing (More Stable)
    - Most Popular Linux Distro #1
    - Uses Gnome as their official DE (previously used Unity)
    - United Kingdom, London & Isle of Man, USA
    - Ubuntu is massively popular because Canonical took a snapshot of Debian testing and made it easy to install and use at a time when Debian was the opposite of easy to install. 
    - My thoughts
        - I have used this distro non-stop since 2006, it has been installed on nearly every computer I own, I have used it for work and personal, and I have always come back to it after a bout of distro hopping, until recently.
        - PROs: I respect Canonical and the work it has done in the past for Ubuntu, and I trust the quality (stability) of the Ubuntu product, and the focus on security.  These are very good reasons to use Ubuntu, especially in a corporate setting.
        - CONs: I feel that Ubuntu 20.04 was the pinnacle release, and every release afterwards has been a devolution.  Canonical has lost focus on keeping Ubuntu competitive as a desktop & laptop distro.  I feel that Canonical is focused on Ubuntu server (which is excellent) and services, and they use the desktop products to maintain their presence in the community. I do not like that modern filesystems are not easily supported by the installer (although it is possible to manually use them).  I feel that Ubuntu is sitting still technologically, while all other distros are adopting better methods (installer, filesystems, features). I also feel that Ubuntu is not a well polished distro, it seems roughly put together, compared to the more polished distros like Manjaro.

    - Cinnamon developer
    - Most Popular Linux Distro #2 after Ubuntu
    - System snapshots are possible
    - This is the most refined Linux distro in the Debian/Ubuntu ecosystem, and among the very best amongst all Linux distros.
    - This distro could be called "Ubuntu configured properly and with a better desktop environment"
    - I have tested this distro many times over the past 10 years, most recently 2022, and i find that i like the cinnamon desktop a lot.  it is simple, clean, attractive, functional.  with gTile I am able to customize window grid snapping.

    - [Documentation](https://support.system76.com/#pop)
    - I tested this distro multiple times, 2022 most recently.  they do some things very well, especially concerning proprietary drivers.  i found the Pop desktop to be distracting and annoying on Gnome, and awful on KDE plasma; perhaps i need more time to understand the desktop.

    - KDE Plasma on Wayland by default.  Calamares installer.  Very nice.  This is how Canonical should have packaged Kubuntu.
