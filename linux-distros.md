Linux Distributions and Flintâ€™s Comments

Notes

- Grouped by Package Managers and the source Linux distro, listing all the derivative (forked) distros.
- All distros use point releases unless specified as rolling release
- Sometimes I note: VERY POPULAR FOR DESKTOP - ***POPULAR***
- I made comments where I have experience with the distro
