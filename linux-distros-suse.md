    - [Tumbleweed](https://www.opensuse.org/#Tumbleweed) = Rolling release
    - [Leap](https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap) = Point release
    - KDE Plasma is the main WM - It is beautiful!
    - Very upstream yet also very stable due to testing - known to be stable
    - Preferred for laptops

    - The YAST installer is exceptional
    - [community](https://opensuse-community.org/)
    - I tested this distro. and I think it is attractive and assembled extremely well.  This is one of my favorite distributions, but I am not using it because I am more familiar with Debian DEB packages than with Zypper RPM packages.  Compared to the other 2 corporate desktop OS distros (fedora and ubuntu) I feel that OpenSUSE is the best put together.
