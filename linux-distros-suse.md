  - [community](https://opensuse-community.org/)
  - I tested this distro. and I think it is attractive and assembled extremely well.  This is one of my favorite distributions, but I am not using it because I am more familiar with Debian DEB packages than with Zypper RPM packages.  Compared to the other 2 corporate desktop OS distros (Fedora and Ubuntu) I feel that OpenSUSE is the most refined.
