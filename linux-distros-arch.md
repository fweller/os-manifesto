Arch - Pacman

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) - ***POPULAR***
    - Rolling release
    - Is the most bleeding edge
    - [Greg Kroah-Hartman uses this distro on his personal computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/fx5e4v/im_greg_kroahhartman_linux_kernel_developer_ama/)
    - ABS (Arch Build System) Uses BSD-style Ports to automate building from source
    - The documentation for this distro is amazingly complete.  I can tell that there is a lot of love and attention put into documenting and testing.
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) - **POPULAR***
    - Downstream of Arch, more testing, more stable
    - Very customizable, excellent installer
    - Rolling release
    - KDE Plasma 5 looks awesome!
        - Also supports Xfce,  Gnome, i3wm
    - excellent tools such as
        - Manjaro Hardware Detection (mhwd) utility
        - Manjaro Settings Manager (msm)
        - Manjaro Hardware Detection Kernel (mhwd-kernel)
    - Austria/France/Germany
    - I tested this distro and I like it a lot!  This is the most compelling distro for me.  If I find that I don’t need to live in DEB/APT package land, and I am willing to learn Arch package names, I will adopt Manjaro immediately.  It is awesome!  This is my non-Debian distro #1
