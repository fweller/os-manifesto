  - excellent tools such as
    - Manjaro Hardware Detection (mhwd) utility

  - I tested this distro and I like it a lot!  This is the most compelling distro for me.  If I find that I don’t need to live in DEB/APT package land, and I am willing to learn Arch package names, I will adopt Manjaro immediately.  It is awesome!  This is my non-Debian distro #1
