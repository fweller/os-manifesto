# General information about Linux

- [Distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/) is very useful for finding and comparing distributions
  - Their [major distros](http://distrowatch.org/dwres.php?resource=major) page is a good place to start your research
  - But pay no attention to the distro page ranking as this number only reveals how many people viewed that distro in the past week
- [Wikipedia Linux Timeline](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg) is a good way to waste a few minutes
  - [FabioLolix/LinuxTimeline](https://github.com/FabioLolix/LinuxTimeline) makes the chart used in the Wikipedia page
- [Wikipedia list of Linux Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions) is mildly useful
- [Wikipedia Comparison of Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions) is mildly useful

## Statistics

- Statistics regarding operating system market share should always be considered imprecise
- The [Statista Global Desktop OS popularity charts](https://www.statista.com/statistics/218089/global-market-share-of-windows-7/) show that Windows is continually losing market share to MacOS mostly, and Linux somewhat
  - Free access to Statista is usually available through a public library
- The [GlobalStats Desktop Operating System Market Share Worldwide](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide) is informative
- This 2022 article about [Ubuntu market-share taking a nosedive](https://lunduke.substack.com/p/ubuntu-market-share-is-in-a-nosedive) is an example of taking the Distrowatch rankings too seriously
- EnterpriseAppsTodays maintains [Linux statistics](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/linux-statistics.html)
  - In 2022 their statistics showed that...
  - Ubuntu accounts for 33.9% of the Linux market
    - That means that over a third of websites that use Linux run on Ubuntu
  - Second place goes to Debian, which accounts for 16% of Linux-based websites, followed by CentOS with a share of 9.3%
  - Other distributions, like RedHat, Gentoo, Fedora, and SuSe, have a much smaller share, i.e., below 1%
    - Their shares are 0.8%, 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.1%, respectively.
  - Red Hat has a 33.9% share in the worldwide server operating environment market
- The [Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/?ref=itsfoss.com#technology-most-popular-technologies) tells us what users of their platform are using
  - Windows: Personal use 62.33%, Professional use 48.82%
  - Linux-based: Personal use 40.23%, Professional use 39.89%
  - macOS: Personal use: 31.07%, Professional use 32.97%
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL): Personal use 15%, Professional use 14.34%
  - BSD: Personal use 1.47%, Professional use 1.03%
- There is also a [Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/)
- Phoronix 2020 article [Linux Kernel Commits per the top 3 commercial distros (Red Hat, SUSE, Canonical)](https://www.phoronix.com/news/RedHat-SUSE-Canonical-Kern-10s)
  - RedHat makes the most commits every year by a wide margin
  - SUSE is in second place at about half of the RedHat commits
  - Canonical is a distant third
- Phoronix 2020 article [Linux Kernel Commits per the top 3 silicon suppliers (Intel, AMD, nvidia)](https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-Contributions-2010s-Kern)
  - Intel has the most Kernel commits by a wide margin
  - AMD's contributions are growing vs Intel every year but are still only half of Intel
  - Nvidia is a very distant third
- [RedHat vs Debian : Administrative Point of View](https://www.tecmint.com/redhat-vs-debian-administrative-point-of-view/) is more of an opinionated comparison between the two than actual statistics
