Independent non-Arch Pacman

- [KaOS](https://kaosx.us/)
    - KDE plasma only (strong focus)
    - x86 only


Slackware - Pkgtool

- [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/)
    - The most stable?  definitely the most difficult!
    - Must manually install GUI ? KDE Plasma
    - SysV Init, LILO
    - Oldest Linux Distro #1
    - I briefly attempted to use this distro in 1995 to create a server for my employer.  I installed the distro on a PC using approximately 40 floppy disks.  I had no idea what I was doing.  I could not get the server to connect to the internet.  Console only, no GUI.  But I am sure that 25 years later the process must be significantly better.

Nix Package Manager

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) -***GROWING POPULARITY***
    - Netherlands
    - All apps in isolation (this is huge) - My friend Carl uses this for development
    - Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it treats packages like values in purely functional programming languages such as Haskell — they are built by functions that don’t have side-effects, and they never change after they have been built.
    - The end result is reproducible and reliable builds
    - There is one installer, it allows the user to select the desktop environment
