  - Oldest Linux Distro #1
  - The most stable?  Definitely the most difficult!
  - Must manually install everything
  - Uses SysV Init
  - Still uses LILO?
  - I briefly attempted to use this distro in 1995 to create a server for my employer.  I installed the distro on a PC using approximately 40 floppy disks.  I had no idea what I was doing.  I could not get the server to connect to the internet.  Console only, no GUI.  But I am sure that 25 years later the process must be significantly better.

Nix Package Manager

- [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) - *GROWING POPULARITY*
  - Netherlands
  - All apps in isolation (this is huge)
  - Nix is a purely functional package manager. This means that it treats packages like values in purely functional programming languages such as Haskell — they are built by functions that don’t have side-effects, and they never change after they have been built.
  - The end result is reproducible and reliable builds
  - There is one installer, it allows the user to select the desktop environment
