[System Installers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_%28computer_programs%29#System_installer)

- [YaST](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST) ([Yet another Setup Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaST))
    - Among the very best!
    - Used by SUSE, OpenSUSE
    - Works extremely well.  Is the most intelligent I have seen.  Incredible for controlling partitions, filesystems, hibernation, swap, etc.
- [Calamares](https://calamares.io/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamares_%28software%29)
    - Among the very best!
    - Used by Manjaro, EndevourOS, KDE Neon, Garuda, Debian Live Medium, Siduction, Spiral
    - This is my favorite.  It appears to offer more partition and encryption options than other installers that I have used.  
- [Ubiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_%28software%29)
    - Used by Canonical for Ubuntu, also Linux Mint uses this
    - It works, it isn't bad, but it is very limited
- Subiquity
    - from Canonical
    - used on Ubuntu server installations
    - 2022 in testing for deployment to ubuntu desktop ([Canary desktop image](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-canary/current/)) and to replace Ubiquity
    - Developed in secret by Canonical engineers.  I guess they were also annoyed with Ubiquity.
    - I tested this installer and it doesn't offer anything better than Ubiquity
- [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_%28installer%29)
    - Used by RHEL, CentOS, Fedora
    - Works well enough
- [Debian-Installer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer)
    - Used by Debian
    - It has improved significantly since its beginnings.
    - It doesn't support all the high end stuff I like
