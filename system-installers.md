# System Installers

The system installer is the software on your USB flash dongle that installs the operating system to the computer.

## List of system instellers that I have used

- [YaST](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:YaST) ([Yet another Setup Tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YaST))
  - Among the very best, possibly the very best
  - Used by SUSE and OpenSUSE only
  - Is the most capable installer I have used
  - Incredible for controlling partitions, filesystems, hibernation, swap, etc.
- [Calamares](https://calamares.io/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calamares_%28software%29)
  - Among the very best
  - Used by many distributions such as Manjaro, EndevourOS, KDE Neon, Garuda, Debian Live Medium, Siduction, Spiral, etc.
  - Can be programmed by the distribution maintainers to be extremely powerful or very simple
- [Ubiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubiquity_%28software%29)
  - Used by Canonical for Ubuntu desktop installations.  Also Linux Mint uses this
  - It works, it isn't bad, but it is very limited compared to Calamares and YaST
- Subiquity
  - Used by Canonical for Ubuntu server installations
  - 2022 in testing for deployment to Ubuntu Desktop ([Canary desktop image](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-canary/current/)) and to replace Ubiquity
  - Developed in secret by Canonical engineers; I guess they were also annoyed with Ubiquity?
  - I tested this installer and it doesn't offer anything better than Ubiquity from what I can observe
- [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_%28installer%29)
  - Used by RHEL, CentOS, Fedora
  - Works well enough, nothing special though
- [Debian-Installer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer)
  - Used by Debian
  - It has improved significantly since its beginnings but it is still extremely limited compared to the best
