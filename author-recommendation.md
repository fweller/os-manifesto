Flint's recommendations for distrohopping

- Beginners getting started with using Linux
    - Start with a beginner-friendly mainstream distro
        - #1 Linux Mint - Best for nearly everyone as a first distro.  Best for people coming from Windows.
        - #2 Ubuntu - Looks like a blend of MacOS and Windows.  Not good for customizations.
        - #3 Kubuntu - Ubuntu with a better desktop interface.  Good for those who like to customize their environment.
        - #4 Elementary - Looks just like MacOS
        - #5 Zorin - Offers paid support
    - Spend time getting familiar with the desktop environment and the package manager
- Intermediate users who have used Linux well enough to try other distros
    - Test other Linux distros in a virtual machine or just install on your computer
    - Try different desktop environments
        - KDE Plasma 5, Gnome, Cinnamon, xfce
        - Form an opinion about what you like and don't like about each desktop environment
    - Form an opinion about the main package ecosystems
        - Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/PopOS
        - Arch/Manjaro
        - Fedora/RedHat
        - OpenSUSE
