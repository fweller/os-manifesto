# Window Managers

A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface.

- [What kinds of window managers are there?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/65083/what-kinds-of-desktop-environments-and-shells-are-available)

## There are 3 types of window managers

- [Compositing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager)
  - This is the standard type used for most Desktop Environments
  - Provides applications with an off-screen buffer for each window
  - Compositing window managers can offer [Grid Tiling](grid-tiling.md) as an extension
- [Stacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacking_window_manager) AKA Floating
  - Draws and allows windows to overlap without using a compositing algorithm
  - For low-end hardware
- [Tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager)
  - For people (mostly developers) who demand fast window tiling on multiple monitors
  -Â "tile" the windows so that none are overlapping
  - They usually make very extensive use of key-bindings and have less (or no) reliance on the mouse
  - Tiling window managers may be manual, or offer predefined layouts, or both
