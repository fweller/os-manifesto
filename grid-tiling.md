Grid Tiling 

Grid tiling offers a way to preform window tiling on top of a standard compositing or stacking window manager.

This is my favorite way to use a window manager because it gives me the tiling control but without the drawbacks.

- For KDE Plasma (only need to use scripts)
    - [kwin-rectangle](https://store.kde.org/p/1545864) ([github](https://github.com/acristoffers/kwin-rectangle)) - the best of all
        - just like MacOS rectangle
