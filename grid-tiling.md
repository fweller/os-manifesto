# Grid Tiling

Grid tiling offers a way to preform window tiling on top of a standard compositing or stacking window manager.

This is my favorite way to use a Window Manager because it gives me the tiling control but without the drawbacks of using a Tiling Window Manager.

## KDE Plasma Grid Tiling

KDE Plasma has recently added some manual tiling functionality

  - newer Gnome releases have broken this script
