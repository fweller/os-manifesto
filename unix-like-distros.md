# Unix and Unix-like distributions that are not Linux

## Unix (UNiplexed Information Computing System)

- [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) was a software project started in 1969 at Bell Labs to build a multitaskting, multi-user, operating sytem.
- [Unix System V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_V) was the first commercial version of the Unix operating system

### Unix implementations that are still in use as of 2022

- [HP-UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX) (Hewlett Packard Unix) by HP
- [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Solaris) by Oracle, Sun originally, for x86 and SPARC
- [AIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_AIX) (Advanced Interactive eXecutive) by IBM for Power Architecture
- [z/OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX_System_Services) UNIX by IBM (certified UNIX) for IBM z/Architecture mainframes
- [OpenServer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenServer) by Xinuos, formerly [SCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Operation)

### Unix implementations that were EOL by 2022

- [SunOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SunOS)
- [IRIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX) by SGI
- [True64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tru64_UNIX) UNIX (formerly Digital UNIX, formerly OSF/1)
- [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP) and [OpenStep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStep) by NeXT (Purchased by Apple)
- [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix) by Microsoft
- [UnixWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnixWare) by Novell, Xinuos, Caldera

## BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)

- [BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) is the direct successor to Unix
- The BSD acronym may also mean Berkeley Standard Distribution
- [History of the Berkeley Software Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Berkeley_Software_Distribution)

### BSD implementations

- [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)
  - #1 Most popular BSD distro
  - The most forked BSD distro
  - Used for desktops, servers, and appliances
- [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/)
  - #2 Most popular BSD distro
  - Focused on highly secure servers
- [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/)
  - Focused on supporting many CPU architectures
- [DragonFly BSD](https://www.dragonflybsd.org/)
  - For the desktop
  - Some very interesting development is happening on this project
- [GhostBSD](https://ghostbsd.org/)
  - For the desktop
- [TrueNAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueNAS)
  - For the NAS (network-attached storage)

## Apple Computer

- Every modern OS at apple is descended from BSD by way of [NeXTSTEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP)

### Apple operating systems

- [Darwin](https://opensource.apple.com/)
  - The open-source base OS for Apple MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS
  - Derived from NeXTSTEP and OpenSTEP
- [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos) *** POPULAR ***
  - #2 most popular desktop OS globally
  - Derived from NeXTSTEP and OpenSTEP
  - Uses the XNU Kernel
  - Uses traditional BSD userland
  - The Homebrew package manager is a necessary add-on
  - My experience with MacOS
    - I have used MacOS (the modern version) since 2015. 
    - This OS feels like a modern BSD/UNIX, it is not stuck in the past
    - MacOS is very stable and very secure
    - Apple is spies on customers less than Microsoft, but can still be quite draconian 
- [iOS] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)
  - Very similar to MacOS, but is mobile

## Other interesting UNIX-like operating systems

- [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/)
  - Redox is a Unix-like Operating System written in Rust
  - Implements a [Micro-kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox_%28operating_system%29) similar to MINIX but written in Rust
  - Offers the Cosmic Rust Desktop
  - This project has a promising future
- [MINIX 3](https://www.minix3.org/)
  - Microkernel
  - BSD compatible, X86 and ARM support
  - Useful to learn how operating systems work
