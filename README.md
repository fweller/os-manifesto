# Operating System Manifesto

This project aims to assist the reader with understanding the differences between Linux distributions so that the reader can distro-hop intelligently.

# History

This project contains my notes on unix-like operating systems (mostly Linux) and desktop environments.  I started writing these notes in the early 2010's to help understand the Linux ecosystem, and have since continued to update the notes as needed.

## Status

I am in the process of transitioning my notes from my EverNote system to this GitHub project.

## Considerations for Linux distro-hopping

These are the topics to consider when comparing Linux distro's

- Does the distribution landing page have a statement about why their distro exists?
- What operating system family is this distribution? (Linux, BSD, others)
- What is the target audience? (experienced, intermediate, beginner)
- What is the target useage? (server, desktop, embedded, everything)
- Is distro focused on stability or bleeding edge or something in between?
- Is the distro sponsored by a corporation or even owned by a corporation?
  - Corporate sponsorship goes a long way to enabling the success of a distribution
- Is paid support available?
  - Paying someone to fix your computer can save hours to weeks of your time.
- How many developers are working on the distro?
  - Thousands, hundreds, dozens, a few, one?
  - Distros with only a few developers can easily become abandoned
- Are packages downstream of another distro or are they pulled from the source
- What is the [release type](release-type.md)?
- What is the [package management](package-management.md) and supported package managers?
- What are the default [application packaging](application-packaging.md) format?
- What is the flagship [Desktop Environment](desktop-environments.md)?
- What is the default [Display manager](display-managers.md)?
- What is the default [Display server](display-servers.md)?
- What [Init System](init-systems.md) is used?
- What are the primary supported [Filesystems](filesystems.md)?
- What [bootloader](bootloaders.md) is used?
- What [system installer](system-installers.md) do they use?

## Linux distributions

The following notes contain a list of all the Linux distributions that I have tried or I at least am aware of.  
I have split the list into 6 notes, each note is specific to a Linux ecosystem (except for the Independent list)

- [Debian](linux-distros-debian.md) is the ecosystem that has the most distributions
- [Arch.md](linux-distros-arch.md) is the fastest growing ecosystem today
- [RHEL.md](linux-distros-rhel.md) is the Red Hat ecosystem that included Fedora
- [SUSE.md](linux-distros-suse.md) is a smaller ecosystem but is extremely good
- [Gentoo](linux-distros-gentoo.md) is an ecosystem where all packages are compiled from source
- [Independent](linux-distros-independent.md) lists all the distributions that are not part of the above 5 ecosystems

## Unix-like and non-Unix distributions

I have notes on [Unix and Unix-like distributions](unix-like-distros.md) as well as some [non-unix-like](non-unix-distros.md) distros worth mentioning.

## Operating system kernels and special Linux kernels

I have notes on [Kernel types and famous implementations](kernels.md) that can be interesting, as well as information on [Linux kernel types](kernels-linux.md) that are available to try.

## Linux history and statistics

Reading about [Linux facts and statistics](linux-facts.md) is entertaining
