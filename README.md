# Operating System Manifesto

This project contains my notes on unix-like operating systems (mostly Linux) and desktop environments.  I started writing these notes in the early 2010's to help understand the Linux ecosystem, and have since continued to update the notes as needed.

I am in the process of transitioning my notes from my EverNote system to this GitHub project.
