# Operating System Manifesto

This project aims to assist the reader with understanding the differences between Linux distributions so that the reader can distro-hop intelligently.

# History

This project contains my notes on unix-like operating systems (mostly Linux) and desktop environments.  I started writing these notes in the early 2010's to help understand the Linux ecosystem, and have since continued to update the notes as needed.

## Status

I am in the process of transitioning my notes from my EverNote system to this GitHub project.

## Considerations for Linux distro-hopping

These are the topics to consider when comparing Linux distro's

- Does the distribution landing page have a statement about why their distro exists?
- What operating system family is this distribution? (Linux, BSD, others)
- What is the target audience? (experienced, intermediate, beginner)
- What is the target useage? (server, desktop, embedded, everything)
- Is distro focused on stability or bleeding edge or something in between?
- Is the distro sponsored by a corporation or even owned by a corporation?
- Is paid support available?
- How many developers are working on the distro?
  - Thousands, hundreds, dozens, a few, one?
  - Distros with only a few developers can easily become abandoned
- Are packages downstream of another distro or are they pulled from the source
- What is the [release type](release-type.md)?
- What is the [package management](package-management.md) and supported package managers?
- What are the default [application packaging](application-packaging.md) format?
- What is the flagship [Desktop Environment](desktop-environments.md)?
- What is the default [Display manager](display-managers.md)?
- What is the default [Display server](display-servers.md)?
- What [Init System](init-systems.md) is used?
- What are the primary supported [Filesystems](filesystems.md)?
- What bootloaders do they use?
- What system installer do they use?
    - Calamares, Ubiquity, Anaconda, YaST, Debian-Installer
